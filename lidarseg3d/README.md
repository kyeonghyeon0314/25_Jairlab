# LiDARSeg3D


A repository for LiDAR 3D semantic segmentation in autonomous driving scenarios. 

Also the official implementations of our ECCV 2022 paper (Self-Distillation for Robust LiDAR Semantic Segmentation in Autonomous Driving) and CVPR 2023 paper (MSeg3D: Multi-modal 3D Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving).



## News

<!-- - [2022-07-14] Initial release for the implementation of SDSeg3D.   -->

- [2023-03-28] Our LiDAR-Camera based method MSeg3D (MSeg3D: Multi-modal 3D Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving) is accepted at CVPR 2023. The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08600), [supplementary material](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12jN0cEH4zSwgArUaMF6HW1HC-eJnEM6p/view?usp=sharing), and code are available.

- [2022-07-19] Our method (MSeg3D) ranks 2nd on the official nuScenes lidar-seg leaderboard and achieves 81.1 mIoU with slight differences among the highly competitive Top3 submissions.

- [2022-07-04] Our LiDAR-only method SDSeg3D (Self-Distillation for Robust LiDAR Semantic Segmentation in Autonomous Driving) is accepted as a poster paper at ECCV 2022. [Paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-19815-1_38.pdf?pdf=inline%20link).

- [2022-06-20] Our multi-modality solution for 3D semantic segmentation won the 2nd place in the 3D semantic segmentation track of CVPR 2022 Waymo Open Dataset Challenges.

## Highlights

- **Simple:** Modules and pipelines can be instantiated via cfg files like [mmsegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation), but more easily applicable to LiDAR 3D point clouds for voxelization, sparse convolution, devoxelization, etc. 

- **Extensible**: Simple replacement and integration for any network components in your novel algorithms. Smooth compatibility for 3D object detector such as [CenterPoint](https://github.com/tianweiy/CenterPoint), since we try our best to preserve the features inherited from [CenterPoint](https://github.com/tianweiy/CenterPoint). 

- **Fast and Accurate**: Accelerated by 3D sparse convolution with top performance achived on SemantiKITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo benchmarks. 


- **Support for multiple datasets and multimodality**: SemanticKITTIï¼ŒnuScenes and Waymo datasets. LiDAR point cloud and multi-camera images.
