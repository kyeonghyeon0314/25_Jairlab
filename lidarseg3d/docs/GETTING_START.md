## 3D Object Detection Task
We tried to keep the features of 3D object detection from [CenterPoint](https://github.com/tianweiy/CenterPoint), but have not tested it seriously yet. If you have problems on 3D object detection tasks under these configs ([nuScene](configs/nusc) and [Waymo](configs/waymo)), please consider referring to the original [CenterPoint](https://github.com/tianweiy/CenterPoint).
